# Setup pstack

Write `.opencode/pstack-models.md`, one line per role. OpenCode loads it automatically through `opencode.json` instructions, so it applies to new sessions. There is no always-applied rule file in OpenCode.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Run `opencode models` and list the `provider/model-id` values you can pass to a subagent. For each one, read its variants from `opencode api GET /api/model` (field `variants`). Variant names differ per model, for example `low`, `high`, `max`, or `xhigh`. The subagent tool omits `model` for `inherit-parent` and `auto` roles. If you cannot detect any, ask the user to paste the IDs they have access to. Never write a real ID or variant you have not confirmed is available. The aliases `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not detected IDs.

### 2. Load current state

The role list below is the mapping. If `.opencode/pstack-models.md` already exists, read it and treat its `# budget` line and its role values as the current choices. Otherwise start from `inherit-parent` on every role. A line whose role is not in step 5 is retired. Drop it.

### 3. Budget, map, and confirm

**(a) Ask for a budget.** Prefer the `question` tool over free text. Offer these four options with these exact labels, and name the current budget when the file records one. With no file, say that `large` matches the skill defaults.

- `unlimited — max reasoning`
- `large — xhigh reasoning`
- `medium — high reasoning`
- `small — medium reasoning`

**(b) Apply it.** Build the working table from the current file, or from `inherit-parent` on every role when there is none, and keep any role you changed by model, list, or alias. A real value is `provider/model#variant`. `unlimited`, `large`, `medium`, and `small` set the variant of every real value, panel entries included, to `max`, `xhigh`, `high`, or `medium`. When a model does not list that variant, use its highest listed variant at or below the target, else mark the role as needing a choice. `inherit-parent` and `auto` do not change. For panel roles (arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena runs one judge. It tries only values from a family other than the parent's, in list order, so order it by preference. An `inherit-parent` or `auto` value never judges. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

**(c) Show the roles and confirm.** Show every role with its model, marking any real ID not in the detected set as needing a choice. Also list each line step 2 dropped. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto` (both mean: this role runs on the parent chat model). Prefer the `question` tool over free text.

### 4. Validate

Every real ID written must be in the detected set, and its `#variant` must be one that model lists. `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen real ID is not available, stop and ask again.

### 5. Write the rule

Write `.opencode/pstack-models.md` with a `# budget` line with the chosen label and its target effort, and one line per role, using the same labels poteto-mode uses. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent. Shape:

```
# pstack model configuration. One line per role. Delete a line to fall back to inherit-parent (the parent chat model).
# `inherit-parent` or `auto` as a value: the role runs on the parent model (omit the subagent `model`). Alias entries in a panel list still count toward its fan-out.
# Real values are `provider/model#variant` (see `opencode models`); the variant carries the effort.
# budget: large (xhigh)

### 6. Confirm

Tell the user which file was written. It applies to new sessions. Re-running this skill updates it.

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-verification-skill` (resolves to `.opencode/commands/create-verification-skill.md`). On no, move on without pushing.

### 8. Offer a formal verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project already has a formal verification skill (a project skill that runs a model checker, a proof, or another verifier against the code). If not, offer once: "want a formal verification skill, so agents can prove a key property of your code holds in every case in scope, not only the cases tests reach? I can generate one with /create-formal-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-formal-verification-skill` (resolves to `.opencode/commands/create-formal-verification-skill.md`). On no, move on without pushing.
